## Getting Started

Install Memori:

```bash
pip install memori
```

### Quickstart

Sign up at [app.memorilabs.ai](https://app.memorilabs.ai), get a Memori API key, and start building. Full docs: [memorilabs.ai/docs/memori-cloud/](https://memorilabs.ai/docs/memori-cloud/).

Set `MEMORI_API_KEY` and your LLM API key (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`), then:

```python
import os
from memori import Memori
from openai import OpenAI

# Requires MEMORI_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment
client = OpenAI()
mem = Memori().llm.register(client)

mem.attribution(entity_id="user_123", process_id="support_agent")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "My favorite color is blue."}]
)
# Conversations are persisted and recalled automatically.

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's my favorite color?"}]
)
# Memori recalls that your favorite color is blue.
```

## Explore the Memories

Use the [Dashboard](https://app.memorilabs.ai) — Memories, Analytics, Playground, and API Keys.


## Attribution

To get the most out of Memori, you want to attribute your LLM interactions to an entity (think person, place or thing; like a user) and a process (think your agent, LLM interaction or program).

If you do not provide any attribution, Memori cannot make memories for you.

```python
mem.attribution(entity_id="12345", process_id="my-ai-bot")
```

## Session Management

Memori uses sessions to group your LLM interactions together. For example, if you have an agent that executes multiple steps you want those to be recorded in a single session.

By default, Memori handles setting the session for you but you can start a new session or override the session by executing the following:

```python
mem.new_session()
```

or

```python
session_id = mem.config.session_id

# ...

mem.set_session(session_id)
```

## Supported LLMs

- Anthropic
- Bedrock
- Gemini
- Grok (xAI)
- OpenAI (Chat Completions & Responses API)

_(unstreamed, streamed, synchronous and asynchronous)_

## Supported Frameworks

- Agno
- LangChain

## Supported Platforms

- Nebius AI Studio

## Examples

For more examples and demos, check out the [Memori Cookbook](https://github.com/MemoriLabs/memori-cookbook).

## Memori Advanced Augmentation

Memories are tracked at several different levels:

- entity: think person, place, or thing; like a user
- process: think your agent, LLM interaction or program
- session: the current interactions between the entity, process and the LLM

[Memori's Advanced Augmentation](https://github.com/MemoriLabs/Memori/blob/main/docs/advanced-augmentation.md) enhances memories at each of these levels with:

- attributes
- events
- facts
- people
- preferences
- relationships
- rules
- skills

Memori knows who your user is, what tasks your agent handles and creates unparalleled context between the two. Augmentation occurs in the background incurring no latency.

By default, Memori Advanced Augmentation is available without an account but rate limited. When you need increased limits, [sign up for Memori Advanced Augmentation](https://app.memorilabs.ai/signup) or execute the following:

```bash
python -m memori sign-up <email_address>
```

Memori Advanced Augmentation is always free for developers!

Once you've obtained an API key, simply set the following environment variable:

```bash
export MEMORI_API_KEY=[api_key]
```

## Managing Your Quota

At any time, you can check your quota by executing the following:

```bash
python -m memori quota
```

Or by checking your account at [https://app.memorilabs.ai/](https://app.memorilabs.ai/). If you have reached your IP address quota, sign up and get an API key for increased limits.

If your API key exceeds its quota limits we will email you and let you know.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

To use the Memori CLI, execute the following from the command line:

```bash
python -m memori
```

This will display a menu of the available options. For more information about what you can do with the Memori CLI, please reference [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/MemoriLabs/Memori/blob/main/docs/cli.md).
